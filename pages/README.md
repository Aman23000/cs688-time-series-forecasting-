# Time Series Forecasting Platform

## Project Overview
This platform aims to democratize the use of time series forecasting by providing an easy-to-use interface for uploading data, choosing models, and viewing predictions. The platform leverages the Jena Climate dataset from TensorFlow, spanning from 2009 to 2016, to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of the Time Series Forecasting Platform include:
- Facilitating user-friendly interactions with time series data.
- Allowing users to easily select, configure, and train forecasting models.
- Enabling users to assess model performance and view predictions through a responsive web interface.
